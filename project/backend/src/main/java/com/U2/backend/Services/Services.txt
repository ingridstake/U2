Services
********
This folder contains all functionality that concerns operating on / filtering data.

Contents:

CommandContracts (folder) : In this folder are all intefaces defined for the different services (command handlers),
                            use these when refering to services in the rest of the application.

CommandHandlers (folder) : Contains all classes that provides some kind of service, they should each implement a
                            interface from CommandContracts - All servicemethods should perferable be non-static
                            so that an instance has to be created (using the factory) before being able to deliver
                            the service. These classes should not be refered to outside the Services folder
                            (use the intefaces instead)

ServiceFactory (file) : This is where all service instances are created, the factory methods should be static and
                        return an instance of the interface of the service rather than the actual service class.
