Data
****
This folder contains all functionality concerning data storage / data conversion (JSON => DataObjects and vice versa).

Contents:

    +DataObjectContracts (folder) : Holds interfaces for all dataobjects in this project and is preferably what
                                     should be used outside the Data-directory in order to maintain abstraction
                                     of the actual data.

    +DataObjects (folder) : Holds the classes that implements interfaces from DataObjectContracts and thus provide
                                     the functionality required to hadle the data.

    +DataObjectFactory (file) : Holds factory methods required for any interpretation of JSON, or creating intstances
                                     of any of the dataobjects, again, this is to maintain abstraction of the data.
                                     (this enables us to avoid any dependcies on the DataObject-classes anywhere
                                     outside the Data directory.) The purpose for the dataObject => JSON-methods
                                     is that you should be able to just send in a list of that contains just the
                                     instances of for example IEvent that should be part of the response and that
                                     they should be "translated" correctly. A similar procedure could be created
                                     for categories if that would become relevant.
